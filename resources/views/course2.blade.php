                <h4>Popular beaches and nearby coastlines are clean and beautiful, because of the governmentâ€™s efforts to keep them clean. However, there are many non-gazetted beaches in Hong Kong which are often strewn with garbage. Not only is this visually unpleasant but it also affects marine life. Garbage will drift with the tide back into the sea, where marine creatures may suffocate by mistakenly swallowing plastic bags and styrofoam.</h4>
